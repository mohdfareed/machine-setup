# Machine

This repository contains the configuration files and Python setup scripts for
various machines. Itâ€™s designed to streamline the setup and update process,
ensuring consistent configurations across all devices with minimal manual
intervention.

## Requirements

- `zsh`: the Z shell.
- `git`: the version control system.
- `python3`: the Python interpreter.

## Usage

To set up a machine, run the following command:

```sh
url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mohdfareed/machine/main/bootstrap.py"
curl -fsSL $url | python3 - [-h|--help] machine path [-f|--force] [-h|--help]
```

Where the arguments are as follows:

- `-h|--help`: prints the bootstrapping help message.
- `machine`: the machine to set up (macOS, RPi, and codespaces are supported).
- `path`: the path to clone the repository into.
- `-f|--force`: forces cloning the repo even if it already exists.
- `-h|--help`: prints the help message of the machine's setup script.

### Setting Up Individual Components

Individual machine components can be set up by running the respective setup
module, provided that the bootstrapping script has already been run. Run the
following command to set up a component:

```sh
python -m scripts.[component] [-h|--help]
```

Where the `args` are the arguments required by the component setup script.

### Updating and Cleaning

To update the machine and reapplying setup config, run the following command:

```sh
python -m machines.[machine].setup [-h|--help]
```

Or:

```sh
./setup.sh machine [-h|--help]
```

## Configuration

The `config` module contains common configuration that is shared across all
machines. It works without dependencies on machines modules.

A machine is configured by creating a new module in the `machines` package,
with the following structure:

```plaintext
machines/
  [machine]/ # the machine's module, includes config files
    __init__.py # defines paths to config files
    setup.py # the machine's setup script
```

### Private Configuration

Some machines can have private configurations that cannot be shared publicly.
These configurations can be stored in a private directory and provided to the
machine's setup script as an argument, where supported.

The following are the private configuration files supported on all machines:

- `env.sh`: private environment variables, such as API keys; automatically
  sourced by `config.zshenv`.
- `keys/`: the SSH keys used by the machine; set up with `scripts.ssh`.

These files can be loaded by calling
`config.load_private_config(config_path: str)` in the machine's setup script,
where `config_path` is the path to the private configuration directory
containing the files.
