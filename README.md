# Machine

This repository contains the configuration files and Python setup scripts for
various machines. Itâ€™s designed to streamline the setup and update process,
ensuring consistent configurations across all devices with minimal manual
intervention.

## Requirements

- `zsh`: the Z shell.
- `git`: the version control system.
- `python3`: the Python interpreter.

## Usage

To set up a machine, run the following command:

```sh
url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mohdfareed/machine/main/bootstrap.py"
curl -fsSL $url | python3 - [-h|--help] machine path [-f|--force] [-h|--help]
```

Where the arguments are as follows:

- `-h|--help`: prints the bootstrapping help message.
- `machine`: the machine to set up (macOS, RPi, and codespaces are supported).
- `path`: the path to clone the repository into.
- `-f|--force`: forces cloning the repo even if it already exists.
- `-h|--help`: prints the help message of the machine's setup script.

### Setting Up Individual Components

Individual machine components can be set up by running the respective setup
module, provided that the bootstrapping script has already been run. Run the
following command to set up a component:

```sh
python -m scripts.[component] [-h]
```

### Updating and Cleaning

To update the machine, reapplying setup config, run the following command:

```sh
python -m [machine].setup [-h]
```

## Configuration

The `config` module contains common configuration that is shared across all
machines. It works without dependencies on machine-specific configurations.

A machine is
configured by creating a new module in the `machines` package, with the
following structure:

```plaintext
machines/
  [machine]/
    config/
      zshenv.sh
    __init__.py
    setup.py
```

Where:

### Private Configuration

Some machines can have private configurations that cannot be shared publicly. These configurations can be stored in a private directory and provided to the machine setup script as an argument.

The following are the private configuration files supported:

- `env.sh`: private environment variables,
  such as API keys.
- `keys/`: the SSH keys used by the machine.

## macOS Backup

- Raycast configuration
